Use SEIR model - tons of work done with SEIR, appears to be the basis of state-of-the-art models
    Need to establish that SEIR is appropriate for measles, use refs
Use modified SIS model for the information diffusion process, or possibly some other one
Consider social network as an overlay on population. Each node of the social network is a person who lives somewhere. For each "somewhere" we can estimate a population density. So for each person in the model, we decide whether they live in a city, town, small town, etc. randomly, using distribution of ppl living in cities vs towns etc.
